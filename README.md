# LeetCode_practice

This repository contains my personal practice for Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) using LeetCode problems, plus a small placeholder area for Machine Learning study material.

Repository layout (short)

- README.md                <- high-level overview and the 9 instruction points
- LEARNING_NOTES.md        <- language-specific learning notes and resources
- Python/                  <- Python DSA solutions, fundamentals, and small ML placeholder
- JavaScript/              <- JavaScript DSA solutions and fundamentals
- .gitignore
